# Assembly-HelloWorld
Basic programs to get you started in assembly (x86, MASM)

This is not intended as a tutorial or a course in assembly language, but rather as a series of simple programs to get started with MASM. It is probably best to start with the first program, helloa, and go from there as subsequent programs won't repeat explanations from previous examples. Note that some of the programs do the same thing, such as exiting the program, in different ways for no other reason than to demonstrate that there are often several ways to to the same thing.
